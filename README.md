## 📈 Analytics Used

### 🔍 **Descriptive Analytics**  
*What Hulu currently offers (titles, genres, regions)*

I began by breaking down the big picture — what exactly does Hulu have?

- Counted **3,073 total titles**, split into:
  - 📺 **TV Shows**: 1,589
  - 🎥 **Movies**: 1,484
- Highlighted the **most dominant genres** using a bubble chart — ***Action & Adventure*** came out on top.
- Mapped global availability, showing that **USA leads with 921 titles**, followed by the UK, Canada, and Russia.
- Created a **rating distribution bar chart** where **TV-14** and **TV-MA** were clearly the most common classifications.

---

### 📌 **Diagnostic Analytics**  
*Why certain content types dominate the platform*

Once I knew the "what," I explored the "why."

- Bigger genre bubbles like ***Action, Adventure*** suggest a strategic focus on high energy, high engagement content.
- Dominance of **TV-MA** and **TV-14** implies Hulu’s target audience is largely **older teens and adults**.
- The content map exposed Hulu’s heavy focus on **U.S.-produced content**, which could reflect licensing or regional sourcing limitations.
- A **stacked area chart by year** revealed major growth after 2017  possibly influenced by the broader shift toward digital streaming and binge consumption.

---

### 🔮 **Prescriptive Analytics**  
*What Hulu could do next*

Finally, I turned the insights into suggestions:

- **Underserved genres** like **Animation** and **Anime** offer a clear opportunity for attracting younger, niche, or international audiences.
- Countries with **low content contribution** (e.g., **South Korea**, **Australia**) are ideal targets for producing original, localized shows.
- With TV and movie volumes nearly equal, Hulu could stand out by investing more into **original content unique to one format** (e.g., Hulu Originals for TV).
